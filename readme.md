## 🛠 Featured Scripts

### 1. Advanced Project Indexer
Generates a professional text report of all project files (e.g., `.ino`, `.cpp`, `.py`) within a directory and its subfolders.
* **Dual Sorting:** Lists by Date (Newest) and Alphabetical order.
* **Smart Logic:** Uses YYYYMMDD for perfect chronological sorting.

### 2. Search & Strip Renamer (V12)
A powerful tool for bulk renaming with a unique "Search & Destroy" undo feature.
* **Custom Strings:** Add any prefix or suffix to files and folders.
* **Undo (No Log Required):** Simply enter the text you added, and the script will strip it from all filenames recursively.
* **Path-Proof:** Anchors to the drive letter to prevent "System cannot find the drive" errors.
